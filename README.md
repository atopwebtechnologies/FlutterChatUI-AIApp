## 🛠️ What We're Building
You'll craft a user interface in Flutter that encompasses the key elements of our chosen design. Focus on front-end and visual fidelity—no backend required for now.

## ✅ Challenge Requirements
- **AppBar**: Style an AppBar with the back button and user's name.
- **Message List**: Display chat messages using `ListView.builder`, with UI distinctions for different message senders.
- **Input Field**: Include a text input field with an attachment icon and a send button, as shown in the design.
- **Send Button**: Create an interactive send button that fits the design's aesthetic.
- **Styling**: Match the design's color scheme, typography, and overall feel as closely as you can.

## 📝 Session Guidelines
- Write clean, well-organized code, reflecting Flutter best practices.
- Engage with us throughout the session—ask questions, think aloud, and share your reasoning.
- Emphasize UI components and interactions, and don't worry about the actual data—mock data will suffice.

## 🕗 During the Session
- We'll start with a quick overview of the design and the specific elements you'll focus on.
- You'll code in real-time, sharing your screen as you bring the chat UI to life.
- Interaction is key! Discuss your approach and feel free to engage us in your process.

## 🔍 Post-Challenge Review
